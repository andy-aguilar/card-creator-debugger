# Card-Flip-Debugger:
Fork and clone down this lab via Github.

To begin, run the JSON server by running "json-server --watch cards.json" in the terminal.

Write your code in index.js

## Deliverables:

1. As a user, I should see a sample card when I open the webpage (hint: a fetch to cards.json should give you a card to work with)


2. As a user, I should be able to add a card by using the form provided.
